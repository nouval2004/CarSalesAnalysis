The "Vehicle Sales and Market Trends" dataset provides comprehensive information on vehicle sales transactions. This dataset includes details such as the year of manufacture, brand or manufacturer of the vehicle, specific model of the vehicle, version or specific package options of the model, vehicle body type, transmission type, Vehicle Identification Number (VIN), state where the vehicle is registered, vehicle condition rating, odometer reading, exterior color of the vehicle, interior color of the vehicle, seller entity or company, Manheim Market Report (MMR) value, selling price of the vehicle, and the date and time of the vehicle sale.
